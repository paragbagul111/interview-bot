# Interview_Bot
My interview bot is an AI-powered tool that helps you practice for job interviews by asking you a series of questions related to your desired position. It also generates an analysis of your answers and provides feedback on areas where you can improve. The analysis is displayed in an easy-to-read format, making it simple for you to understand your strengths and weaknesses in the interview process.
